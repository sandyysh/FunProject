README for "Jump WalkingBall"

Introduction:
This is a simple jumping ball game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player controls a ball that jumps over obstacles while avoiding collisions. The game ends when the ball collides with an obstacle.

Getting Started:
To play the game, open the "Project one.html" file in your web browser. The game can be controlled by either clicking the "Jump" button or by pressing the spacebar on your keyboard. The player must jump over the obstacles without colliding with them.

Prerequisites:
To play the game, you will need a web browser that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Installing:
There is no need for installation to play this game.

Usage:
The game can be played by clicking the "Jump" button or pressing the spacebar on your keyboard. The player must jump over the obstacles without colliding with them. The score increases for every obstacle the player avoids. The game ends when the ball collides with an obstacle.

Code Description:
The "Jump WalkingBall" is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file contains the layout and structure of the game. The CSS file provides styling to the HTML elements. The JavaScript file contains the game's logic.

In the JavaScript file, jQuery is used to select the walking ball, button, and grid elements. The game has two functions, "jump" and "fall," which move the ball upwards and downwards, respectively. The game also has a function to generate obstacles, which are appended to the grid element. The score increases for every obstacle the player avoids, and the game ends when the ball collides with an obstacle.
